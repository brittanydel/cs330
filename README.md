With this project, I was introduced to several new tools, such as OpenGL and Visual Studio, and several new concepts in using C++ for graphics and computer visualizations. I learned to work backwards by using a photo of a scene and reducing it down to the most basic shapes. I then used Visual Studio and C++ to create these basic shapes, add texturing, and lighting. This process aided in design by breaking down the development process into stages. This approach could be applied in future applications by breaking down the desired software specifications and developing in stages. 

Moving forward, I would like to utilize computational graphics and visualizations for more personal uses rather than educational or professional ways. I am now finishing my undergraduate degree and will likely pursue a graduate degree in bioengineering or physics, and since I don’t foresee myself continuing a career in Computer Science, any further work with this skill will be for personal use. Something I came across recently is “algoraves” in which people live code visuals to music- I think this would be really fun to do!
